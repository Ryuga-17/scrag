## About
This project proposes a robust web scraper designed for maximum adaptability. It automatically adjusts to various website structures by employing a multi‑strategy extraction approach. The scraper attempts to extract clean, structured text and metadata (including title, author, and date) using methods such as newspaper3k, readability‑lxml, and BeautifulSoup heuristics. In cases where these methods are insufficient, it can optionally fall back to headless browser rendering to capture content from more complex, dynamically loaded websites. The output is specifically formatted for integration into Retrieval‑Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines or for use with local Large Language Models (LLMs).

An ambitious, optional extension to this project is the Universal RAG Builder. This layer would automatically identify and scrape top‑ranked websites relevant to a user's query, subsequently building a RAG index from the collected data. This feature addresses a key limitation of local LLMs, their inability to browse the internet by providing automated knowledge aggregation and up‑to‑date information retrieval without requiring manual data collection. The project's user interface will initially be a Command Line Interface (CLI), with plans for a web‑based version to cater to users who prefer a more visually appealing display.

## Features
- Multi‑strategy extraction: newspaper3k, readability‑lxml, and BeautifulSoup‑based heuristics.  
- Metadata capture: title, author, and date when available.  
- Optional headless rendering fallback for dynamic, JS‑heavy pages.  
- RAG‑ready output: clean, structured content suitable for chunking and indexing.  
- CLI first: simple commands to fetch and export content; web UI planned.

## Roadmap
- Universal RAG Builder: auto‑discover top results for a query, scrape them, and build a ready‑to‑use RAG index.  
- Web UI: a lightweight interface for users who prefer a visual workflow.  
- Export adapters: convenient formats for popular vector DBs and RAG frameworks.  

### Current Release (v1.0)
-  Multi-strategy extraction: newspaper3k, readability-lxml, and BeautifulSoup-based heuristics
-  Metadata capture: title, author, and date when available
-  CLI interface with configuration management
-  Extensible pipeline architecture

### Universal RAG Builder (v2.0) - In Planning
Split into two focused EPICs for better implementation:

**EPIC 1: Web Crawling & Discovery System**
- Discovery Query: Convert user intent to search strategies
- Search Integration: Web search APIs, RSS feeds, sitemap discovery
- Intelligent Fetching: Rate limiting, retry logic, content deduplication
- CrawlManager: Robust error handling and job orchestration

**EPIC 2: RAG Index Construction**
- Multi-model Embeddings: Support for various embedding models
- Flexible Storage: Abstract IndexStore interface for different backends
- Optimized Retrieval: Fast semantic search and query capabilities
- Content Chunking: RAG-optimized text segmentation


### Documentation & Research
-  `/research/` directory: Maintains architectural decisions, spikes, and institutional knowledge
-  Spike-driven development: Thorough research before implementation
-  Comprehensive issue templates: Clear Definition of Done for all tasks

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1) Fork and clone
# Click Fork on GitHub, then:
 git clone https://github.com/ACM-VIT/scrag.git
 cd scrag

# 2) Create a branch
 git checkout -b feat/your-feature

# 3) Install dependencies
 uv sync
 uv pip install -e src/scrag

> **Note:** This project uses `uv` as the canonical dependency manager. Dependencies are defined in `src/scrag/pyproject.toml` and managed via `uv.lock`. Do not use `pip install -r requirements.txt` as the root `requirements.txt` has been removed to avoid conflicts.

# 4) Verify the CLI
 uv run scrag info
```

---

## Usage
Run the Typer-powered CLI after syncing dependencies (as shown in Quick Start).

```sh
# Extract a single page using the default strategy cascade
uv run scrag extract https://example.com/article

# Choose a custom output location and persist as plain text
uv run scrag extract https://example.com/article --output data/custom --format txt

# Relax the minimum content length requirement for sparse pages
uv run scrag extract https://example.com/article --min-length 50
```
